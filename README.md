# IoT-Based-baby-monitoring

 Internet of Things-based Baby Monitoring System is proposed as an efficient and low-cost IoT-based system for monitoring in real-time. This project presents an idea to design a Smart Cradle System using IOT which will help the parents to monitor their children even if they are away from home & detect every activity of the Baby from any distant corner of the world. It is an innovative, smart & protective monitoring system to nurture an infant in an efficient way. This system considers all the minute details required for the care & protection of the Baby in the cradle. The design of smartness & innovation comes with the use of technologies/methodologies which include the Internet of Things (IoT) (Modules like esp32, Humidity & Temperature sensing), Cry Detecting Mechanism, Live Video Surveillance, Cloud Computing (Data Storage) & User Friendly Web application (for User Controls). In order to detect each & every activity of the Baby, different Sensors/Modules are attached to the Cradle: Humidity & Temperature Sensing Module for detection of Wetness of the bed, A Camera on top of the Cradle for live video footage & Cry Detection Circuit to analyse Cry Patterns. All the data which has been taken from the sensors/modules will be stored in Cloud (Thing Speak) & analysed at regular intervals.
